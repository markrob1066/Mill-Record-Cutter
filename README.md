This is a simple utility to take a raw format 8 bit mono audio file and convert it to a CNC G code program that will will cut a single loop of the passed audio via a milling machine using an embossing tool.  The user must determine the sample rate of the incoming audio and make sure the audio is in a raw 8 bit signed format. Playback speed, cut diameter, cutting depth and excursion limits are manually set by the user along with CNC parameters, safe move height and feedrate.  The program will output a .nc file that when run on a mill, cuts a single circle at the specified diameter with audio added as offets to the baseline diameter path such that when played back on a turntable, the original audio will be audible. The mill spindle is not running during the cutting and it is assumed that a conical embossing tool is loaded into the mill.  The center of the circle is as 0,0 and no hole is drilled or boed bt the outpit G Code.
